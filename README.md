# Bam hard to soft clip Converter and tag transfer

This tool was built to facilitate usage of LAST alignments (which outputs hard-clipped alignments without additional tags) with remora resquiggling (requiring soft-clipped alignments). Surprisingly I couldn't find a tool that was able to do this transfer, so out of necessity I decided to create one myself. The complexity here lies in the fact that there were over 100 LAST alignment files, whose reads were randomly distributed within the 5 M read unaligned BAM output from dorado. I did not find a way around loading in the read data to be transfered into memory first, however even for these 5 million reads, this worked decently well with this implementation (likely because it stores them in their native data types). 

Build it as every other Rust tool (`cargo build --release`), and use it as described in its help text (`target/release/bamButler -h`)
